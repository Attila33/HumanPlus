# HumanPlus

This program will represent the jellyfish Turritopsis nutricula since its DNA pattern,
its aging, its way of life, its move, its environment and its diet to determine what makes
it immortal and how to transmit the results of this work to humans.
In short, the ultimate goal of this work is to find the key of the eternal life.
